Milestone Project 1 - MouseCode Design

Website of Thomas Jones Offering services as a web developer

Initial conception - The site was originally going to be my resume, similar to the website used for the mini-project for this module. However whilst sketching out the design on paper I decided to make a site offering my services as a web developer which I might use and update in the future.

Basic structure - The site consists of two pages. The main page is scrolling page with separate page areas. Each page area has a link with an ID anchor which so it can be accessed directly from the header or footer navigation section. The header navigation is fixed and remains as you scroll down the page.

Design / User Experience - The site has been designed to walk a visitor through the process of purchasing my services as a web developer. The first thing a visitor to my site sees is the banner with my name and the title 'Full Stack Web Developer'. This immediately reassures the visitor that they have reached my website. Next there is an 'about' section which builds on this information showing a picture of myself and a paragraph explaining who I am and what I do. Now that the visitor knows who I am and what I do the next part, the 'portfolio' section gives them some real world examples of the sites I've built. This information is consolidated by the following 'services' section which lists all the services I offer my clients as part of my web development business. The site is structured so that by the time the visitor reaches the 'Packages' section they know who I am, what I do. They have seen examples of my work and knows exactly what services I offer. Purchasing a website is a relatively expensive investment for most small business owners (the target audience) therefore the idea is to reassure the potential customer as much as possible before they reach the 'packages' section which is the product that I'm selling. There is a large contact button at the bottom of this section so that visitors can contact me immediately after viewing this section without having to search for the contact link at the top. The final section at the bottom contains three tabs. The first contains information about my technical expertise. The second details more reasons why the visitor should hire me - my unique selling points.The final tab gives details about refunds if for some reason I'm unable to complete the project. Each of these sections is designed to give the potential customer more confidence in hiring my web development services.

Modifications - The scrolling page was originally longer but this caused problems with the navigation layout (too many sections/links). The two options I considered were a drop down menu in the main navbar or tabs in the bottom section of the page. I opted for the later as I felt it fitter better with the single scrolling page design. The second page is smaller with just a single section with a contact form with basic HTML5 validation.

3rd Party Code - The site was built from a bootstrap 3 desktop first template which has been customised. Few of the original features of the template remain; only the fixed navbar, the main title/banner (boundInUp) animation and the banner arrow effect have been kept along with some of the basic bootstrap grid layout. The desktop first design has been changed to mobile first. The colour scheme, typography and content are original except for the skills and services sections which have been customised.
