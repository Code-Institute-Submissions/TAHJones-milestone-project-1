Milestone Project 1 - MouseCode Design

Website of Thomas Jones Offering services as a web developer

Initial conception - The site was originally going to be my resume, similar to the website used for the mini-project for this module. However whilst sketching out the design on paper I decided to make a site offering my services as a web developer which I might use and update in the future.

Basic structure - The site consists of two pages. The main page is scrolling page with separate page areas. Each page area has a link with an ID anchor which so it can be accessed directly from the header or footer navigation section. The header navigation is fixed and remains as you scroll down the page.

Modifications - The scrolling page was originally longer but this caused problems with the navigation layout (too many sections/links). The two options I considered were a drop down menu or tabs in the bottom section of the page. I opted for the later as I felt it fitter better with the single scrolling page design. The second page is smaller with just a single section with a contact form with basic HTML5 validation.

3rd Party Code - The site was built from a bootstrap 3 desktop first template which has been customised. Few of the original features of the template remain; only the fixed navbar, the main title/banner (boundInUp) animation and the banner arrow effect have been kept along with some of the basic bootstrap grid layout. The desktop first design has been changed to mobile first. The colour scheme, typography and content are original except for the skills and services sections which have been customised.
